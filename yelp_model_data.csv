6,7,"A completely unplanned visit in the vicinity bought my husband and I to Tuba Turkish Restaurant. It was a Saturday night and we showed up without a reservation. There were a couple names ahead of us in the waiting list and we reached during peak dinner hours so our wait was quite long (around 40 mins).But as soon as we got a table, the service was quick and we got our order pretty soon. One bite of the FALAFEL and we realized that our 40 minute was completely worth it. It was the perfect flavor-packed fritter with a crisp cover. The bed of Hummus on the side was also delicious.We also got the SIGARA BOREGI which was basically fillo dough stuffed with potatoes, feta cheese, parsley. It was a slightly on the blander side for me but my husband loved it.And since my husband is a vegetarian, we got the MUSAKKA to share. It was unlike any of the Musakkas I've had so far. Eggplant stuffed with the holy trinity of potatoes, zucchini, and mozzarella cheese and topped with béchamel sauce - this dish was a showstopper! The rice and salad served on the side went perfectly well with the eggplant.Not to forget, the complimentary BREAD PLATE served in the beginning is really good too!I am definitely going back to sample more dishes from their menu.

recommend the Adana Kebab.  Wrong choice!  One kebab, well done, tougher than wood.  Seasoned nice and slightly spicy, I liked the riceand charbroiled assortment of vegetables.  But was too pricy for one kebab, and really not good.  [$22, 2.5 stars]Vibe & Energy============Both good.  Every seat in the place was taken, loud with big talkers.  Music could be more present.  Overall, I

9,10,"I wish this place were better... Judging from the past reviews and the pictures, I could not wait to try out tuba. The appetizers were phenomenal actually! For appetizers we had baba ghanouj, kibbe (ball shaped ground meat), and their complimentary bread. Who doesn't love free bread? And I was pleased with the Kibbe which came on a bed of labneh! However, the main course was a huge disappointment. It was a skewer of lamb, and came with very little veggies... rice... very paltry!

I can't remember the name. All was very tasty -- I liked that the grape leaves had a touch of sweetness, and while it's relatively difficult to mess up hummus, Tuba's is smooth and creamy and tahini-y and scrumptious.For my main, I had trouble choosing between the salmon and the lamb chops, but ended up getting the latter and was very happy with my choice. It was excellent -- they didn't actually ask how I'd like the meat cooked, but it came out as a perfect medium/medium-rare which I was very happy with. Super flavorful -- I was literally sucking the bones to get as much meat off as I could. It was served with a handful of roasted veggies and some rice on the side, which tasted good but I thought could have been a little more robust in portion and presentation.Overall, an excellent experience at Tuba!

35,36,"I made a reservation here at 6pm on a Sunday through Yelp (which by the way is super convenient). That probably wasn't so necessary as the restaurant was still quite empty at 6 and there were plenty of two-person tables. The place did become quite filled by the time we left around 7pm. It was muggy outside and the heat carried into the restaurant which unsurprisingly does not have AC. SF is not equipped for this kind of weather. It thankfully cooled down as the sun set. The flavors of the dishes we had were all delicious but the amount of food felt incredibly small. Portion control, I guess. The service was excellent. The complimentary flatbread they bring out was yummy and perfect for eating with the accompanying seasoned butter, olives, and feta as well as the cold mezes. We also used the bread to pick up the oils from the mezes. The waitress brought us another basket presumably after seeing us wolf down the first plate of bread.     KIZARTMA (Cold Meze)This appetizer came in two mounds of pan-fried eggplant, bell peppers, and zucchini topped with tomato sauce. (Both mezes came in twos actually.) I loved the natural sweetness of the vegetables (technically fruits but you know what I mean). And they were chopped and cooked to perfection. The small scoops left me craving more. CEVIZLI EZME (Cold Meze)A mix of walnuts, Turkish red pepper paste, tomato paste, fresh garlic, olive oil, and cumin, this  signature meze had incredibly deep flavor. It was a wonderful blend of sweet and savory. The walnuts added a nice, nutty texture. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this combination of ingredients. I also appreciated the bed of spinach.  ADANA KEBABA succulent kebab of spicy ground beef with lamb mixed with green and red bell peppers. The meat was very tender and easy to chew. I didn't think it was spicy at all. The portion was extremely small and probably not worth the price. It did come with rice and grilled and pickled vegetables which took up most of the plate.  KARNIYARIK (Signature Entree)My favorite out of the two entrees. Even though there was half of a whole eggplant, I wished there was more of it. The baked eggplant was wonderfully tender, but its subtle flavor was overpowered by the ground beef, tomatoes, onions, and chopped parsley stuffing which was exceptionally seasoned. The flavor was very rich and deep. I could see it pairing quite well with pasta. Although I appreciate leafy greens, the salad was a bit boring. All in all, I had a very enjoyable and hearty meal here. Everything was so flavorful and aromatic. I noticed that prices have gone up by $2 for the Cold Mezes and $3 for the Signature Entrees based on the menu posted in 2014 which is somewhat more reasonable than another place I went to that started raising their prices within a month.

54,55,"4.5 starsTuba is an absolute gem!  It was the perfect answer to my craving lately for Mediterranean food.   This is a really good restaurant for regular dinner, a celebration, or a family meal.  The restaurant offers a selection of hot and cold mezes, soups and salads, entrees and desserts.  Let's not forget the specials of the day (these are specials you really want to pay attention to).  Many of of the items are vegetarian and/or gluten free.  They serve wine and beer, but no cocktails.  The restaurant itself is on the small size but it never felt crowded.The food is simply prepared but with really fresh ingredients.  I thought the dishes we ordered were incredibly healthy and tasty.  Make sure to ask about the specials (did I already say that?).  On the night of my visit the specials were lamb shank and sea bream.  The fish was really fresh.We started our meal with an order of their signature meze, the Cevizli Ezme, which is a dip made of walnuts, red pepper paste, tomatoes and various spices.  It was thick and creamy and the perfect start to the meal when spread on bread.For the entrees we shared the Adana kebab and the roasted sea bream.  The single kebab was described as spicy but I didn't find that to be the case.  However, it was flavorful and moist.  The dish came with some vegetables, pickles, a yogurt sauce and rice.  The fish was delicious, fresh and perfectly cooked.  They offered to debone it for us but still presented it as if it were whole.  The sea bream came with a salad, vegetables and pickles.  Cups of turkish tea and a plate of Kunefe, sweet cheese coated in shredded phyllo soaked in syrup and nuts rounded out the meal.  The dessert wasn't too sweet or too rich and paired well with the earthiness of the tea.The portions sizes were just right and I felt the prices were fair for the quality of the meal.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The restaurant was full the entire time of our visit and service never lapsed.The restaurant is located in what I regard as the quieter section of the Mission such that parking was fairly easy (okay, I really lucked out).   I would regard this as a neighborhood spot I

When we arrived, the restaurant wasn't full, but over time it filled up quickly. As soon as we ordered the appetizer platter, it was out in less than 10 minutes.

We definitely didn't go wrong with this choice, because each item on the platter was incredible and absolutely delicious. For the entrees we each ordered our own. Some of the items that we tried were the Karidesli Salata, Karides Tava, Tavuk Sis, Adana Kebab, HünkarBegendi. Each item had its own peculiar taste and was exceptional. For the chicken and ground beef and lamb kebobs I expected their to be at least two skewers, so the portions were pretty small. The eggplant entree was absolutely mouthwatering and the lamb chunks were super tender. Overall it was a great experience.

Either I'm very fortunate to have had AMAZING middle eastern food or other folks haven't been exposed to real authentic food and service. Trust me, there's way better food out there. I really wish I hadn't come to this place. Food: Portions are amazingly small, rice tasted bland with no color or flavor (other places I've tried have ""jeweled rice"" or at least it's flavorful).

We tried Baklava for dessert...disappointing to say the least so we didn't finish it. I've had much better and authentic in the Bay Area. Service: Restaurant is overwhelmingly understaffed and they don't know how to manage the restaurant. Don't expect the multiple hosts to tell you the truth about wait times. The night we went had no host so different servers had to fill in. That's crazy for a busy weekend. SEVERAL parties outside (in the cold) had ""reservations,"" yet no tables were available for even a small party.

85,86,"Warm, comforting atmosphere, with delightful Turkish cuisineIf you're looking for a different dining experience in San Francisco's Mission District, you won't find a better place than Tuba. Like the name implies, the restaurant serves authentic Turkish cuisine and it is outstanding! I went there with some friends for dinner last night and we couldn't have been more pleased. The lamb chops are delicious; some of the best I have ever tasted. My wife ordered Adana Kabab (spicy ground meat) which also was wonderful.The service is friendly and efficient; the ambience low key and very welcoming. Prices are moderate.

108,109,"How can I convey how perfect my dinner here was? To give you an idea, I usually scarf down my food; a minute or two and even the largest plates are empty. Tonight I wanted every bite to last forever. The service is impeccable too - every server was polite, extremely attentive, friendly and informative and not to mention: beautiful!Whatever your fancy, you just must try the red lentil soup and the falafel. At first bite, the soup left me wanting ; I was waiting for a kick or a spice. At second taste, I was pleasantly overwhelmed at the texture and the layer of ingredients melded together. This was comfort in every bite; this was a rainy night, post breakup, cold season, long day bowl of warm hugs. Am I exaggerating? I felt better about humankind when that bowl was empty - 15 minutes later. My eyes and hands worked my way in circles around the table in every effort to make that soup last. And to my delight, there was so much else to pique my interest. The falafel was the best I've ever had. I'm not an expert in falafel but I've never met a falafel I didn't like. If it's on the menu, I will order it regardless. This wasn't your average falafel though. If there is a falafel heaven, Tuba's is falafel god. The texture was perfect - a slight crunch and flavor that made my tongue dizzy. Butter it up generously with hummus and you don't need anyone else to make it a date.And then came the entree. Our server used the word ""juicy"" twice in her description of this chicken dish served - in laymen's terms - in tomato sauce and a medley of mushrooms and other accompaniments. She could have used it thrice over and it still would have not sufficed. This chicken is to die for. Every morsel was like reuniting with a long-lost lover. I couldn't finish it. Shock and horror, but I didn't want this night to end!

Between two people, we split the Tuba Meze Tabagi (basically the cold appetizer sampler), Adana Kebab (beef and lamb kabob with grilled veggies), and the Kofte (beef patties with grilled veggies). The appetizer sampler is excellent, though probably better suited for 4+ people (our server told us that, but our eyes were bigger than our appetite).

150,151,"I was very excited about trying out this restaurant when my Los Angeles friends happened to eat here, and told me they enjoyed this restaurant so much they wished there was one just like it here in Los Angeles. Being from Los Angeles myself, I made sure I visited Tuba Restaurant the next time I came to San Francisco. I called and booked ahead of time. Reserved a table for a party of 9 people. I told them over the phone that I was from Los Angeles and how excited I was about trying their authentic Turkish cuisines. At first glance, the restaurant is chic and cozy, on a cute little street. Street parking was hard to find. Once we sat down, with my American family, I introduced myself to the server and told them that I am Turkish and that I am very excited to be here. I told them about how much my friends had raved about their food, and thus, I brought my whole American family from San Francisco to try their food. We decided to eat family style, with lots of big dishes to share. At first we ordered a bunch of appetizers. So here is the part that drops the stars from 5 to 3: The first combo appetizer plate we get, I take a bite off the spinach dip and there is a hair in it! Immediately I spit it out, quietly, and drop it off to the floor so the rest of my party is not grossed out. But I am now very grossed out and dissapointed. I then call our server and tell her, quietly, in Turkish, that I got hair in my food. She looks at me in disbelief, and instead of apologizing, grabs my plate and brings me a new one. I decide that I am not going to ruin my whole family's experience so I tell no one. After all the appetizers are finished and we move on to the entree, the same server comes back and asks how everything was. I tell her the food was good, and then she says, ""well I hope the good food made up for the bad start"".  I tell her ""yes"" and we continue to eat. We order: appetizer platesigara borekseveral plates of lamb, several plates of combination kebabs, MantiTurkish wine, Various deserts: Kunefe, baklava, helva, chocolate pyramidTurkish coffee and turkish tea.Our bill is $500 plus tip.So here is my verdict: 1) Although they had charged us 20% gratuity, they never told us so my husband ended up giving them an additional 20% tip on top 2) Even though the food was great, the hair in my food at the very beginning was a big buzz kill. What was even more annoying was at no point did they attempt to apologize about it. She just kind of looked at me in disbelief. What I expected, instead, was for them to apologize and perhaps bring a desert as a gesture for apology. Generally, in such establishments, that is the right thing to do. Especially for a table this big, who just dropped almost $500 for food, the least you could do is take out a desert or two off the bill as a sweet gesture of apology.

For the same total price of the bill we all went to dinner with 8 people a few days later at a different restaurant. I was debating between the lamb chops and the special, lamb shank. The waitress recommended the shank over the chops so shank it was. The portion size was huge. The lamb was tender and the sauce was fantastic. It wasn't too gamey which I was a fan of. My meal was good. My hubby ordered the beef/lamb kebab which I thought had pretty good flavor but again the high price tag on it makes you question it's value.

We saw great reviews and photos; however, when we got there for our 6:15 pm dinner, it was not available. ""Sold out"" was what the server told us. Ok, a huge disappointment, so instead of deciding to order an appetizer to share and then main entrees, we decided to share a few appetizers. We decided on a few options, Turkish cigars (Sigara Boregi), zucchini fritters (Mucver), meatballs (Icli Kofte), prawns with in tomatoes, feta cheese and garlic in pepperoncini sauce (Peynirli Karides). I specifically asked if that was way too much for us in which our table server responded ""that's good."" Not once did she tell us it was way too much food for two. Unlike other restaurants, they'll straight out tell you if you ordered way too much and then it's up to the customer to want keep what they have. However, a couple of disappointments led us to a bad experience. Our food came out all at once in tiny small table that could not accommodate all our food.

Given that it was all hot items, we would of enjoyed it if they brought out 2 dishes at a time so we could enjoy it while it was hot, but that was not the case, despite me asking our server if she could possibly not bring it all at once. ""Too late"" was her response. We didn't even get to enjoy our hot food since it quickly got cold before we could move on to another dish. Not only that, my bf who is Turkish was not impressed with the food. All the dishes were mediocre and nothing beyond fantastic. My bf even made a joke about Michelin recommended huh?

The one thing I did not like Seattle eating scene is that they charge you for the bread, even those terrible ones that I won't even feed the pigeons with. I don't understand it. I like a place that makes yummy authentic Turkish bread and serve them with three kind of dipping sauces. All free of charge. And they did refill and the refill was a basket of warmer breads. Can I just eat that instead? Of course not. Ordered their signature cold meze which is called Cevizli Ezme. It's a big portion and very flavorful. Then for a hot meze we did Içli Köfte. It's impossible to pronounce so of course it's deliciously foreign and exotic. Stayed away from the salad based off Tracy's review.

The meaning of life is contemplated over a cup of warm Turkish tea. Dark no-running cloud hovering my heart. Just then, he said, when you get better, we should try that Egyptian place in Outer Richmond. ""Remember that place?"" Yes indeed. We ate dinner after running once by there.

Well, this place showed that you can find any flavour in any part of the world at same level. I am really glad that I found this place. Now, it is one of my favourite restaurants in SF for sure.

272,273,"First visit here tonight. This restaurant came HIGHLY recommended by a foodie friend who has worked in the fine dining industry (both in the kitchen and front of house) and knows about GOOD food. Much thanks to him for introducing me to what is now one of my favorite restaurants in the bay area, not to mention favorite Turkish restaurant hands down.

290,291,"Is 'Tuba' a Turkish word? I typed it on Google Translate under Turkish, and the English translation came out, get this...'tuba'. Then I Googled it as 'Tuba Turkey' and found out it was either a scientific organization ousted by the current administration, the Turkish Academy of Sciences (TÜBA), or the first name of a Turkish supermodel. Something tells me I've been over-thinking this one, but I will say I like finding good Turkish restaurants in the city. Alongside Machka in FiDi and Troya in the Inner Richmond, this one may be the best of the bunch.Located next to the far trendier Beast & the Hare on Guerrero near 22nd, it's as dark as a sultan's private tent, but I guess it's all part of the exotic mood they are trying to evoke. Of course, a loudish work party of fifteen wasn't doing anything to enhance the mood. I was seated at what appeared to be part of their take-out table next to the register. I didn't mind since I was there on my own to try some of their food. First came the complimentary Homemade Grilled Turkish Bread with three little dishes - a whipped hummus, a couple of olives bathing in oil, and a crumble of feta cheese (see photo). It was nice and warm and probably too much for one person, but who's complaining?As a starter, I decided on the $9 Tuba Salad, quite a large plate of freshness with chopped hearts of romaine, tomato and cucumber mixed with some Turkish touches - cranberries, pita-based croutons and a sprinkle of paprika (see photo). It was a bit like a Caesar in a whirling dervish. My entree was the priciest thing on the menu, the $23 Grilled Lamb Chops. I was feeling cocky since a Yelp deal popped up with my check-in which gave me $5 off my meal. It was a quartet of nicely charred lamb chops artfully arranged with a scoop of rice, a ramekin of yogurt sauce, and sautéed vegetables - a seeded pepper, a grilled half-tomato and a pile of julienned carrots and mango (see photo).It was deliciously savory, though as I always feel when I eat lamb chops, I found the quantity of meat a bit skimpy to the critical point where I need to decide whether I pick up the bone and gnaw. I was alone, so of course I did. And yes, I had dessert. Go ahead. Mock me. I've tried Künefe at Machka and knew it would be too overwhelming, so I went with the very satisfying $5 Sütlaç, a small crock of oven-baked rice pudding with a layer of burnt milk skin on top (see photo).

293,294,"Decided to try Tuba for dinner after a friend recommended it. It was absolutely delicious. We got the Sigara Böregi, which is fried fillo dough wrapped around potato and some other fillings. It looked like an egg roll. The palate came with 4 pieces and yummy garlic yogurt sauce, which was enough for two people as an appetizer. For the entree, we shared the Tavuk Sis. The chicken was the perfect consistency, buttery, and melted in my mouth. The plate also came with garlic yogurt sauce in addition to a grilled pepper, bell peppers on the kebab stick, carrot slaw, rice, and some pickles. It's something where if you want to eat all the components separately you can or you can mix everything together which is the method I preferred.

Though a bit on the pricier side, the food was really delicious and filling. We had the awesome meze platter as a group and destroyed it pretty quickly.

My brother and sister-in-law were in town from the East Coast, their first visit here, and I wanted to bring them to an interesting restaurant near my house. The reviews for this restaurant are quite strong, so I felt confident booking a reservation for us for 6:30 seating on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was pretty much empty when we arrived. The woman who was our waitress was a Slender Woman with curly dyed blonde hair and a very Stern expression. She did not greet us but asked us if we were ready to order. As it happened the fourth member of our party had not yet arrived. He was 5 minutes late. But she was insistent in standing over us waiting for us to order, so I rescued the moment by suggesting that we have some drinks and order appetizer. She did not say those words; I had to tell her that we could proceed that way. No sooner did the appetizer arrive, and we began sampling it, she came up again with a Stern demeanor, an impatient facial expression --- no welcoming, no warmth---really a cold person---and asked us to order our entrees now. I asked her are you in a hurry? And she looked at me with no change of expression very cold and said no, and then continued standing over us. So we interrupted our appetizer and figured out what we wanted to eat and took care of her needs. Not ours. Not our needs at any point in this meal. We were still finishing our food, and let the busboy know that we were not ready to have him clear. But he went ahead and started anyway. And I looked at him and said no! I had to raise my voice to get him to understand that we weren't finished, we still wanted to have our plates. So this was terrible really. I've never had such an aggravating embarrassing and really kind of humiliating experience in a restaurant before. It was made worse by the fact that I was trying to show my guests a good time, and we had the opposite of a good time.  Everybody agreed it was terrible, deliberately rude service.  The female server was by far by far the most offensive and quite calculated in doing it.   We are friendly,  polite people , and in no way deserved such cold, rude treatment.  The two stars are for good food, but it in no way compensates and I will never return to that restaurant under any circumstances that's how strongly I feel about the experience we had there.

They were also served with a small green salad.The Bread plate: which they give everyone is really nice.

It had a nice amount of pepper in it that I appreciated and I felt it unnecessary to add a squeeze of lemon (which came with it). Falafel Salad: The falafels were a little to firm for my preference but they were delicious just the same.

She'll be impressed by the selection of kebabs at Tuba.  Chicken, Lamb, Shrimp, etc.  If she's feeling indecisive, she can get the mixed grill. I ordered the Shrimp Kebabs and they were awesome ($17). Two sizeable grilled skewers of large shrimp with little wedges of lemon in between. The cool, creamy cucumber yogurt that came with it was a great accompaniment as were the perfectly cooked julienned veggies, roasted tomato, and rice pilaf that rounded out the plate. Hummus fans will enjoy Tuba's version as it is smooth and garlicky ($6).  Lentil Soup lovers will adore Tuba's pureed and flavorful tomato-y version. ($5) She will enjoy the sexy ambiance.  Deep red walls, brightly colored geometric art, elegant embroidered pillows, dark wood furniture, a cozy bar in the back, and warm and friendly service up front will help you seal the deal. 3) And don't forget to say: ""I can't believe, I'm sharing a kebab.  With the most beautiful girl I have ever seen with a kebab.""

Eggplants and  mozzarella mash topped with a red beef stew (Amazing). Finally Kunefe and tea. We had no room for this at all but it had to be done judging by how great the meal was. My +1 the kunefe expert says it is one of the top in the world. Too sweet for some but the tea cuts through it well if unsweetened. You could maybe ask for the syrup on the side too.

424,425,"Authentic Turkish Cuisine is served here in an elegant ambiance. Ezme, Manti and irmik helvasi dessert are traditional fare that many places don't offer and those three things were some of the most memorable and tasty eats I had while visiting Turkey. I know everyone thinks kabobs when they think Turkish food but there is so much more to the cuisine than meat on a stick. The Ezme was something I had from a street vendor in Istanbul. This was the cart that the locals lined up for. The Ezme paste of crushed walnuts, tomatoes and spices were slathered in a lavash style piece of bread and then whole leaves of romaine lettuce were placed on top and rolled up to be easy to eat as you roamed around the city. At Tuba they present it a bit more elegantly with the paste prettily plopped on a plate and the bread broken into pita chip like pieces to scoop it up with. The Manti is similar to beef ravioli but the sauce that tops it is a yogurt/tomato sauce. This is good stuff. The creamy , tangy yogurt sauce is incredibly addicting. It's also pretty to look at with the contrast of white and red swirled together and not completely mixed. The irmik helvasi is a semolina flour desert that I stopped a passing boy in the Grand Bazaar to try. In Turkey, the ice cream was encased in the flour mixture but here it's served on the side. The slightly gritty texture of the moist semolina tastes heavenly with the cold smooth accompaniment of ice cream. Tuba restaurant is a great find for authentic Turkish delights here in the states.

Not telling me where we were going, I had no idea what sort of food we were getting...but hey! Tuba was definitely a pleasant experience!He made reservations at 6pm. We arrived late due to traffic and walked in at 6:15pm. Parking wasn't bad, but you definitely have to look.The restaurant only had 2 other tables when we sat down. This place is very quaint. Dim lightening, colorful decor, and a special scent within the restaurant. It was relaxing, yet very classy. We were than greeted by a waitress that handed us the menu and poured us glasses of water. Being the very first time of having Turkish cuisine for both of us...we needed some time to digest the menu. Momentarily, this gentlemen came over and asked if it was our first time. We later on figured out his name was Burke. He gave us recommendations and was very personable. As my boyfriend butcher the names of the dishes, Burke was so nice to tell us that it is pronounced the way it looks. We decided to go with:Appetizer: Cevizli Ezme Walnuts, Turkish red pepper paste, and tomato paste with fresh garlic, olive oil, and cumin. SO GOOD! The bread was fresh and delicious. The red pepper paste really caught Mr.MC's attention. It complimented the bread very well. It was tasty.For entrees, we went ahead and ordered two to share:Sarma Beyti Kebabi -  Adana kebab wrapped in lavas bread, topped with homemadetomato and garlic yogurt sauce. VERY saucy. If you are not someone that likes too much sauce, you might not like this dish. However, this dish was very flavorful. The garlic yogurt sauce was just right. It wasn't sour or anything. It was a generous portion.Manti - Dumplings stuffed with ground beef, topped with garlic yogurt sauce,pepper flakes and dried mint. The dumpling were tiny! They were bite-sized! But the meat within was very fresh. The ground beef was a tad bit dry, however, it didn't both us because it paired well with the the sauce as well. Bread and water were refilled without request. We were able to eat the bread with the yogurt sauce as well!At the end, we were stuffed but we HAD to order Pyramid Noisette Chocolate to satisfy my sweet cravings and 2 orders of the Turkish coffee. I am a coffee lover and I approve! Turns out Turkish coffee isn't in a cup or glass, it actually comes in a super tiny small mug shot. Very strong.Burke was very helpful and personable throughout our whole dining experience. He definitely made our first Turkish cuisine an awesome one!

472,473,"After visiting Istanbul I've come to appreciate Turkish food, and aside from what you would get in the motherland Tuba is the next best thing. In my opinion it's the best Turkish restaurant in the Bay Area.On my last visit we had the icli kofte appetizer which is ground beef mixed with walnuts, rolled into a ball, covered in breading, fried, then served on a bed of yogurt. How can you go wrong. Other menu standouts I've tried include beyti kebap (kebap wrapped in lavash bread and topped with tomato and yogurt sauce), manti (meat dumplings served in yogurt sauce--I guess I really like my dairy) and Adana kebap. The Adana kebap is different then those I've had elsewhere (and from what I'm told more authentic). The meat had a softer texture and was a lot spicier, so keep that in mind. I find most Turkish food pretty heavy so by the time I'm done with an entree I feel like I'm going to die and therefore too full for dessert. If you don't have that problem I'd suggest the kunefe and or irmik helvasi.They have a nice selection of Turkish beers (gotta love Efes Dark) and wines. I had the red Kavaklidere which was like a pinot noir and very good.Service is friendly, but that may be because I always come with native Turkish speakers.

483,484,"Unfortunately, I do not agree with the rest of the Yelp community regarding this restaurant. The service and the food was nothing special and I will not be coming back. Let's start with the service. As soon as my friend and I entered, we got a bad taste in our mouth. I made open table reservations for 5 people and at the last minute, another friend of mine decided to join. I forgot to update the open table reservation, but didn't think it would have been that big of a deal. When I mentioned that there will be one more person joining us, the man who greeted us did not look happy. He was snappy with me and told me that they have a table for 5 already set up with us but he ""guesses"" that he can sit us at a larger table. Sorry, I didn't realize adding an additional person was going to be that big of a deal... I'll go on --- when our waitress asked my friend if he would like a recommendation of their Turkish wine, she recommended the most expensive glass of wine on the list. It's not as though my friend had a problem paying for it, it was more principle and a bit shady. Our water glasses were never refilled unless we asked. Also, I noticed that the same man that greeted us, rolled his eyes at one point when he walked by our table for no reason at all. I understand that our party may have been louder than the rest of the parties (we like to laugh and talk and not just stuff our mouths - sorry), but we do not deserve to have somebody who works there roll their eyes at us. In fact, I believe that man is either the owner or the Manager. As for food... nothing special. Their hummus was probably the only decent item from everything else we had ordered. The only annoying thing that happened (and never happens at other restaurants) is that my friend has an allergy for gluten and asked for cucumbers instead of their bread for the hummus. Although they were able to accommodate her, they charged her extra for 8 slices of cucumbers. Again, it's not about the money, it's the principle. For my main dish, I had their shrimp. The shrimp tasted extremely bland and they had no Turkish feel to them whatsoever. It came with plain rice and some veggies. I could have made it at home and saved my money. The rest of my party were also not thrilled with the food. All in all, I don't recommend this place.

506,507,"Thanks to Groupon I now know about this lovely Turkish restaurant. I've been a happy vegan at other Turkish restaurants, especially in NY, so I'm thrilled to find a good local one.I ordered the lentil soup, dolmas, and hummus. My partner ordered the stuffed falafel. The Turkish bread is wonderful -- kind of like really good focaccia but better. Softer.The lentil soup looked different than I expected -- thicker. The taste was quite nice except it had a kick to it. I'm a bit sensitive to hotter spices (peppers) so my partner finished it and loved it.The dolmas were superb -- more olive oil then the tangy lemon or whatever is used in other dolmas. There were a few pine nuts and maybe cornichons...they were simply delicious, okay?Now...I am a hummus connoisseur. I ate hummus multiple times every day I was in Israel and there are subtleties involved. This hummus was creamy, tasty, and definitely lacked that heavy lemony taste that many hummuses (and just what the hell is the plural for hummus?) -- for me -- ruin the experience.By the way, my partner loved the falafel -- stuffed with cheese -- as it was nice and moist.

This space has been the death of a number of restaurants in the time I've lived nearby so I'm hoping Tuba can make a go of it. It's delicious and the people are lovely.We started off with the hot appetizer platter for the table. All of it was delicious. The things that really stood out were the crab cake and the Mücver which is a shredded zucchini patty with cheese. Delicious flavor and texture. We also liked the Sigara Boregi which are little cheesy egg roll like things made of deep fried filo.The absolute gem of a main course though has to be the little meat dumplings called Manti. OMG.

555,556,"I've been living rurally for 8 years, and have been without choices of restaurants. I lived in Turkey 15 years ago and claim the cuisine as my favorite. So obviously I was eager to remind my palate of the joys of Turkish food. Tuba was perfect!  The warm moody atmosphere calms the eyes and prepares the palate for exciting sensations. The staff is friendly, efficient and fun. The food is presented like art, and went beyond my expectations.

574,575,"My husband and I ate here on a Friday night - HIGHLY suggest reservations. The food was outstanding - We started with an appetizer - spinach, yogurt and garlic served with bread and feta, olives and herbed butter. Very nice dish. I had the Karides Tava, which is shrimp sautéed with wine, garlic asparagus, olive oil, and lemon juice, and was lovely. Very light, very flavorful. My husband had the Sarma Beyti Kebabi -- Adana kebab wrapped in lavas bread and topped with tomato and garlic yogurt sauce -- also wonderful and flavorful. And we capped the meal with their signature dessert: Künefe layers of kadayif (shredded fillo dough) filled with sweet cheese, served with homemade syrup and pistachio nuts. You can have it with ice cream, we opted to leave it plain. It was delicious as was the Turkish coffee - I asked for it not to be too strong and medium sweet and it was PERFECT.It's a wee bit crowded, the tables somewhat closer than I like, but the atmosphere overall was very nice and relaxed. Our only quibble was the service was...strange. A waitress appeared almost immediately after we were seated to tell us the specials and then asked to take our order - being new to the restaurant, we needed more time to look over the menu, but she never came back. The owner/manager came over, asked if we wanted wine - we didn't - and then hovered a moment, so we figured he wanted to take our order, so we gave him our appetizer order and he said, ""I will let them know"" and left without taking our entree order. The appetizer arrived very quickly, but no one came back to take our entree order even though we still had the menus on our table. We were busy eating the appetizer and almost done with it by the time I realized our entree order hadn't been taken, so I told said something when our water was refilled and we finally made our order. The dishes arrived pretty quickly, so it wasn't like we were waiting forever for our food, but it was still strange. And the couple who was dining next to us had to ask repeatedly for a sharper knife to cut the lamb he had for an entre - the butter knife just wasn't doing the job even though the lamb was tender. So....great food...the service was strange for us, but not to the point that we wouldn't go back there again since we got our food in good time and it was all delicious (which is why we go to restaurants in the first place).",5,8/6/2014,Genuine,1,2,2014-08-06 00:00:00,1,my husband and i ate here on a friday night  highly suggest reservations the food was outstanding  we started with an

However, here it is hands-down much better than most places I've been....and I have been a food-obsessed/gardener/cook/eat-out-a-lot person for the 20 years of my adult life. There is just something about the quality of the food and the way it is lovingly prepared at this place.This is my first five star review for a reason - it's consistently very high quality, the portions are huge, the service is really good and often the chef will come out and check to see how you are doing. The ambiance is pretty nice too, although the only knock I can possibly think to give it is that sometimes it gets a little too packed with people and then it gets too hot because the kitchen is going full steam...but they will open the front door if no one objects.OK, let's start with the service: very attractive and sweet female servers (I believe they are all Turkish too), super helpful at picking out wine from their extensive list, I have also seen then handle a couple of difficult situations with grace and leaving the customer feeling good.The food: did I mention HUGE portions? You can easily get full on the appetizers and amazing bread, but be careful not to because you really want to leave room for the rest of it. The lamb is always cooked to perfection, the shrimp is succulent and good in every dish it is in - but especially the Pistachio Crusted Prawn Salad, their falafel is not too dry and full of flavor, I loved their zucchini appetizer and the lentil soup....I even tried their eggplant dish with my friend who is veggie and liked that (and I don't usually care for eggplant unless the flavor is completely masked.)When should you try this place? Any time you have people in your party who are vegetarian, vegan, picky or indecisive - I've been here with all of these types and everyone has left happy and full. Also, just come here for a date or when you want one meal to last you for three in leftovers. I've been here going on 10 times in the past year.

595,596,"Turkish cuisine can be one of the Wonders of the World.  I happily traveled my way through this country several times, meals scattered between hair raising taxi rides, stimulating public bus transportation and nonstop encounters with friendly, inquisitive Turks eager to feed me. This comfortable restaurant is fine, but for its price it fails to introduce its guests to the best addictive and unique culinary experience that Turkey offers. We sampled the meza so we could sample all of the cold appetizers. The Hummous and grape leaves were no better than those available elsewhere.  However, the Cevizli and Kizartma (eggplant) were delicious. In a traditional Turkish neighborhood place, you would be invited into the kitchen to view and sample. The special of the evening was leg of lamb; two of us ordered it. Others ordered the Mussakka, sautéed shrimp and stuffed eggplant.  The lamb special came was well received (I didn't sample it). The sautéed shrimp , Mussakka and stuffed eggplant were also good, but doesnt the price demand something special?  Mussakka is a standard option in many Turkish and Greek restaurants, and this one was tasty, but again, was it distinguishable from the same dish served at other places?  The stuffed eggplant is also a classic dish which was well prepared.  My guests enjoyed the sautéed shrimp, but we wondered if it was a Turkish dish: not sure. The tab (including 2 glasses of wine and 2 turkish coffees) came to around $270 not including tip. I would recommend Tuba for those who want nicely prepared Turkish food in a comfortable setting, but after 3 trips here, I feel it falls short for its price. While not as comfortable, the offerings at Gyro King (especially the lunch specials) and Ala Turca are just as satisfying at a third the cost.  The truth is, I have yet to discover a Turkish

It's located on busy Guerrero St., and visiblly close to the corner of 22nd St. I found a parking spot on the next block. What I love about SF - are little pockets of businesses/restaurants at intersections such as this one - a little urban oasis nestled in between The Mission and Noe Valley.I walked into a really cozy, yet modern space, with no more than a dozen to a dozen and a half tables, maybe. The walls were colored a deep, warm red; the tables and chairs were made of dark wood; the really chic lighting and pops of colorful art really made the aesthetics inviting and comfortable. The server came by to take our drink order, and was taken aback, and perhaps offended that I wanted a Turkish coffee before dinner. She said that it wasn't too great for digestion...yet she doesn't realize that I've had it before, and drink coffee as easily as I drink water! I still asked for it.There was flat bread on the table, and it wasn't pre-packaged, or dry, compared to anywhere else that I've had it. It had a really great texture, yet was soft, and moist, like homemade American bread.My companions had ordered the hummus (which came with more flat bread), and it was super creamy, smooth, and the BEST that I have ever tasted. You could tell from the texture of it that it was ""super homemade."" ...and I now realize that most places probably have it pre-packaged.  It also wasn't oily and didn't have the puddle on the top like you find at other restaurantsFor my entree, I ordered the Adana Shish -Spicy ground sirloin and lamb at $15. I tried to order it extra spicy, but understandably, they couldn't do it because the meat was pre-mixed/pre-prepped with the spice.Shockingly, my entree arrived before I had a chance to finish my Turkish coffee! I'd say it was less than 15 minutes to wait for my food - which was cooked to order, and nice and hot.The shish was really super moist. It came with a grilled tomato, a grilled chile pepper, a large (but not overkill) serving of rice, onions, dill yogurt sauce, and of course, the shish kebab at maybe a foot long. Note that the beef/lamb meat combo is usually a really good flavor combination because you don't get that overpowering taste from the ground lamb, yet, you also get the natural beef fat from the ground sirloin to juice-it-up. Since I asked for extra spice, they served me up with a helping of hot sauce! All-in-all, it was enough food to keep you full in the stomach, yet not so much that it sends you over the edge with a to-go box to boot!For dessert, I ordered Baklava $6), which I NEVER pass up. The layers of filo were thin and flaky, which was good, and had some honey in it. This was definitely one of the best I have ever tasted, and not dry like I've had at most places.To summarize, I would have given this place five stars if it weren't for the mediocre service. Not to the fault of anything or anyone, with the exception of circumstance, there was a slight language barrier with the server. Note that this is NOT a criticism.

An older gentleman) that he was so sorry, but we would have to wait a few minutes, on account of our early arrival.  Ok, NBD, we stand outside the doorway like awkward creepers and check out their menu.  We ended up waiting for over 15min before I requested to be seated outdoors.  They quickly set up the table, and we ordered pretty much immediately upon sitting down.  It took them another 15min to bring us water, which they never refilled.FOOD: The food arrived lukewarm to cold at our table... which was quite unappetizing.- Falafel ($7): Very loosely packed falafels (4) with a small mound of hummus.  This app came out nice and hot, and was fairly satisfying.  I prefer a denser falafel but the flavor of these were good.- Mercimek Corbasi (bowl $7): Red lentil soup in a bowl was a decent sized portion, but did not come out quite as hot as I would've liked.  It had a pretty sour edge (the addition of the accompanying lemon wedge was a bit overkill)... the versions of lentil soup I had while in Turkey were never this sour, and were way more savory.  This was mediocre at best.- Sebzeli Guvec ($18): A lamb cube casserole with assorted veggies (zucchini, bell peppers, onion).  The lamb was really gamey, but the worst offense was that this dish was COLD.  J said his half was fine, but practically every bit I ate was ice cold in the center.  So unappetizing!  The side salad was nicely (lightly) dressed, and the rice was fine.OVERALL: Having to wait more than 10+min for a table when we had a reservation already put Tuba Restaurant on the naughty list.... The kicker was the COLD FOOD, which really turned me off from Tuba Restaurant and earned it a 2star rating.  Price seemed to be reasonable for SF (~$40 including tax+ tip for 2 apps & 1 entree), but I

I miss the east coast where people show up when they say they will. The place was packed so I was feeling anxious to get my food. We order the feta prawns to share as an app and for dinner, we get some sort of homemade meat stuffed pasta in cream sauce and plenty of bread (amazing btw). 1) The decor was not that impressive. We could have been in any fancy restaurant. It didn't scream Turkish culture. 2) Service was nice and friendly and always checked on us for water. They didn't bat an eye when I said 1/2 the party flaked. 3) Portions were a little skimp but w/ the bread, the pasta and app filled me up.

wander in here after discovering that la provences summer hours mean that theyre closed on mondays and tuesdays perhaps the owners actually go to provence in the summers we arrived at tuba around 530 on a tuesday and were seated right away certainly no need for reservations at that hour though per other reviews showing up later may warrant oneupon entering we were stilled by the dark wood and red walls a grounding effect that welcomed the enormous and hearty dinner we were about to consume starting with the cold sampler plate impressive in its fresh taste and interesting variety including dolmas zucchini salad eggplant salad hummus etc coupled with the delectable feta prawns i must admit that we were already getting full before the entree we were sharing per our servers recommendation arrived that stopped us not in the least once our hearty mixed grill came dang thats some good meat the tuba mixed grill gave me a tromboner so sorry i couldnt help myself topped off with a fine

the time our show was about to start.  It wasn't their fault since we got there with about an hour to spare and had ordered appetizers.  It ended up to be too much food anyway, so that was a good thing.They give you some amazing bread and spiced butter!  Again, the bread was AMAZING.  It was really flavorful and went absolutely well with the spiced butter they provided.   We probably got about 4 refills of it (talk about generous).  We got champagne also.  I decided to try the yogurt drink they had.  Boy was that rich.  It was definitely good for you, but it was really rich.  Quality for sure!  I had to share that with the table to finish the glass.  They were kind enough to bring small samples for each of my friends instead of me having to pour some into empty glasses.  That is really nice of them and thus, it goes to show how good our waitresses were.The dishes included two different types of eggplant selection, a falafel  salad, and a salmon dish.  All the dishes except the salad came with rice and salad as sides.  Great portions, and I must say, the rice was delicious.  Not sure how they cooked it, but it went well with everything we had ordered.After our show we

687,688,"Cozy/crowded spot. We had dinner here on a Saturday night when we couldn't really agree on what to eat. Despite our reservation, we had to wait a while because it was absolutely packed. We had the sigara boregi (fried feta cheese) to start, he had the kofte kebab and I had the lamb shish kebab. Overall, good sized portions and pretty tasty.

(How many times can you go back to Luna Park?)The flatbread is off the charts good. Soft, chewy with wonderful accompaniments of sundried pesto butter and feta. I ordered two mezes: a falafel/hummus plate and the feta cheese and potato phyllo rolls. So good and filling. It is the perfect place to get soul warming food on a cold, wet San Francisco summer evening. The portions are HUGE.

714,715,"Merhaba Tuba! Welcome to my neighborhood; I've been waiting for you for soooo long!I can't begin to describe how excited I am about this place. When people ask me what I miss about Turkey (I moved to the US in 1994), my answer  always begins with the same duo: ""I miss the Aegean Sea and I miss the food."" I always add that I also miss Turkish hospitality. Well. The Aegean Sea remains far away, but Tuba brings to my adopted home, the Mission, both the food and the hospitality that I'd been missing. Reservations (in response to an earlier review): I made reservations on Opentable.com, and upon arriving at the restaurant (a little after 6 pm--I was rushing to get to a show that night), I realized I didn't need to. The place was empty when I arrived. I think more people began coming in around 6:30 or so. By the time I left the restaurant around 7:30 pm, the restaurant was full, but there were still tables available. My suggestion: if you can, use Opentable.com -- it's handy, has an iPhone app, and you get credit the more you use it.  Hospitality: My partner-in-crime wasn't there when I arrived at Tuba, so I stood there for a second, looking at the menu. The owner immediately noticed me and welcomed me in. As soon as I sat down, he asked if I would like some tea or coffee while I waited. We chatted a bit about his restaurant, and because he doesn't have his liquor license yet, he encouraged me to bring my own from the store at the end of the block if I needed some beer or wine with my meal. He mentioned he expects to get his license in the next two weeks (this was about a week ago). He was happy to provide a corkscrew or a bottle opener and glasses for us. Such a warm person. I immediately felt at home in this space, and getting to speak in Turkish with him was an added bonus. The food: My ultimate test of authenticity is the dolma. I can walk into a Middle Eastern café, take one look at the dolmas, and be able to tell whether they're from a can or homemade (sorry to say, folks, most of the time, they're from a can). A restaurant, of course, is different. I asked our waiter if they were homemade just in case, and they were...and they were almost as good as grandma's. Almost. My partner-in-crime, who apparently doesn't usually like dolma, ate all of his, so there you go. The other appetizers we got were the sigara börek and ezme (the regular kind, not the zucchini kind). The börek was great (careful with your first bite--it's hot!), and the ezme was out of this world. We tried in vain to stop ourselves from spreading the ezme on the delicious pide (not pita) bread so we didn't get too full. Well, we did get too full, and we weren't so hungry at 6 pm to begin with. Fortunately, we had ordered the mixed grill to share (the one-person version rather than the mixed grill for two). It came with lamb chop (fantastic!), chicken kebab, shish kebab, adana kebab, rice, and veggies (I think I'm forgetting one more kind of kebab on there). It was plenty of food for both of us after all the appetizers, and yet another affirmation that Oh. Yes. I do looooove meat on a skewer. With no room for dessert, I had to skip the irmik helvasi that I was looking forward to sampling. Next time! Just thinking about the menu makes my mouth water. There's so much variety and deliciousness on that menu that I just can't wait to return! Bonus points for Tuba: 1. As someone who learned English as a second language, and who is now an English teacher, I have an instinctive habit of recognizing typos and grammatical errors on menus, especially when they're not American restaurants. I saw no errors on Tuba's menu. 2. Wine-red walls always make me feel at home...so do beautiful dark wood furniture.",5,30/11/2011,Genuine,1,2,11/30/2011,1,merhaba tuba welcome to my neighborhood ive been waiting for you for soooo

Perhaps you've just launched into a sotto voice diatribe about how not awesome the mole/falafel/burger/hip food of the moment you ordered is.

The critical wheels of your brain are well lubricated with 30 weight haterade and you're already salivating over the next Yelp bomb you'll drop perhaps as soon as right then if you can punch out something appropriately pithy on your ninjaphone. You stop and wonder if your urge to disassemble your dining experience is, itself, crapping on your dining experience or (sometimes more importantly) the experience of your homies. Well, I'm here to say ""funk that!"" Top off the pretty hate machine with another quart of vitriolade and let it rip. Like I'm about to. The oh-so-soon to be missus wanted to give these guys 1 star. We could go with 1.5 stars, let's call it that. We'll round up to 2 thanks to our $25 of flat, unseasoned Turkish food for $12 Groupon and the two glasses of wine they comped us for the 52 minute wait between our salad and main courses. This place is pricey homes and doesn't really show out with anything to set it above your corner schwarma shop. In fact, we both ranked it a solid cut below the late night kabob cart (see NYC). Why? Lack of flavor! Dings - regular bread at the table - weird. Nothing specifically wrong with it but we were expecting pita and it didn't quite jive with the food. - cold dip thing tasted like... hmm, mostly nothing - Sheppard's salad was basically a Greek salad but ended up being a LOT of cucumbers, a few bits of tomato, red onion, 4 olives, and some parsley. - manti pasta was uber watery, bland, and chef boy-r-dee tasting with little or no sauce or taste beyond general ground beef - kabob sampler was the highlight, everything well cooked but somewhat under seasoned (a recurring theme)The worst gripes were the total lack of communication in the service. Almost an hour between salad and mains without any kind of communication in the interim sucks.

it usually happens in the company of others perhaps youve just launched into a sotto voice diatribe about how not awesome the molefalafelburgerhip food of the moment you ordered is it could be after a snooty aside about the played out decor or the indifferent service the critical wheels of your brain are well lubricated with 30 weight haterade and youre already salivating over the next yelp bomb youll drop perhaps as soon as right then if you can punch out something appropriately pithy on your ninjaphone you stop and wonder if your urge to disassemble your dining experience is itself crapping on your dining experience or sometimes more importantly the experience of your homies well im here to say funk that top off the pretty hate machine with another quart of vitriolade and let it rip like im about to the ohsosoon to be missus wanted to give these guys 1 star we could go with 15 stars lets call it that well round up to 2 thanks to our 25 of flat unseasoned turkish food for 12 groupon and the two glasses of wine they comped us for the 52 minute wait between our salad and main courses this place is pricey homes and doesnt really show out with anything to set it above your corner schwarma shop in fact we both ranked it a solid cut below the late night kabob cart see nyc why lack of flavor dings  regular bread at the table  weird nothing specifically wrong with it but we were expecting pita and it didnt quite jive with the food  cold dip thing tasted like hmm mostly nothing  sheppards salad was basically a greek salad but ended up being a lot of cucumbers a few bits of tomato red onion 4 olives and some parsley  manti pasta was uber watery bland and chef boyrdee tasting with little or no sauce or taste beyond general ground beef  kabob sampler was the highlight everything well cooked but somewhat under seasoned a recurring themethe worst gripes were the total lack of communication in the service almost an hour between salad and mains without any kind of communication in the interim sucks after a few attempts to get information on when we could expect our food we were met with confusion did you get your salad yet and then lame excuses the pasta takes a long time to cook what pasta takes an hour to cook every restaurant can have bad kitchen nights and this might have been one of them our server did her best to recover and was gracious and

727,728,"When you tell the server multiple times that you're allergic to chilies, peppers, and all manner of spicy food, they should be able to recommend a safe option from the menu. Instead, I was told they could make anything without spices. So I ordered the Kafte Kebab... And it was definitely too hot for me when it arrived. I suspect it had red pepper or cayenne, but I couldn't tell for certain. :( This is why I give four stars instead of five.Fortunately one of my dining companions had ordered the ""Stuffed Salmon with fume sauce over rice,"" and he was eying my kebab with entree envy, so we switched plates.

the doorway, they didn't get irate and let us take our time.  I know how unwieldy a large group like that is, so I really appreciated their patience with us.The food was delicious!!  I don't know that

garlic yummmm.  The bread and butter were really tasty too.  For my entree I got the beef ravioli (I don't remember what it's called, started with an M) in some sort of tomato yogurt sauce.  It was so good I ate it all, which is pretty rare for lil ol' me!  Also had the Turkish pilsner Effe, which was pretty good as well.Once our large and unwieldy group had finished eating, we stayed on chatting (part of this large group were six high school friends, some of whom hadn't seen each other in 8 years) for a good 20 min.  Which could be kind of a jerk move if the place was busy, but there wasn't anyone waiting for a table by that point.  The wait staff never rushed us or asked us to move along, again I really appreciate that sort of thing.To summarize: Yummy food, good atmosphere, friendly

746,747,"My first experience with Turkish food and I'm smitten.I went here last week with my new Turkish friend who took it upon himself to introduce me to this amazing cuisine. We started out with Dolmas, which I have had before and enjoy, and Icli Kofte which were DELICIOUS! I've been thinking about them ever since and can't wait to have them again. Basically they're made of spicy ground lamb breaded and fried into the shape of a small football. My mouth is watering.From there we moved to the main courses: Hunkar Begendi and Beyti Adana. The first one is unlike anything else we have in America. It's basically mashed potatoes made out of eggplant. I was perplexed. And of course, it's topped with delectable lamb chunks.

We asked for one special request which was promptly served. Our water and wine glasses were refilled and our plates were removed quickly upon finishing. FOODThe food was very tasty.

commented on how ""yummy"" our food looked.  Plus, Tuba is the only restaurant that allows you to bargain for reservations.  A snippet of our phone conversation:Me: Do you have a table for two available tonight at 7:00?Tuba: I'm sorry sir, we are really busy tonight - does 6:30 work?Me: No, that'll be too early, I'm coming straight from work...Tuba: How about 8:00?  We have a great table for two at that time...Me: Hmmm...well, I am pretty hungry...how about 7:00?Tuba: Sure, I see an opening - see you at 7:00!Service aside, this is the best Mediterranean I've had in SF (sorry La Mediterranee - but you've had that spot on my list for 3 years now).  Dinner started out on a low point - we had the dolmas, which were pretty blah.  Between our shrimp kebabs and salmon, both our main courses were excellent - the salmon had an explosion of flavors I don't usually associate with salmon or med food.  Finally, kunefe for dessert was absolutely amazing - it's proves that if

For example, an avocado salsa on one of the salads and the pistachio encrusted prawns.  Being it was our first time at the restaurant, we decided to go basic with the cold appetizer platter, the sauteed shrimp in the pepperoncini sauce, and a side of the falafel. We also ordered a couple of glasses of wine.  I'd give more stars for the ambiance, decor, and all over set-up.  Tuba does have a nice, cozy vibe.  Even romantic.  The artwork is an interesting choice - my friend had just had her eyes dilated and wondered if the paintings she saw were the result of her slightly blurred version. To start they offer complimentary bread accompanied by a nondescript red aioli type item, a few chunks of feta, and one olive.  The bread was my favorite part of the meal.  The server  indicated that they make it fresh daily.  The feta was nice and my friend and I split the one olive. The dip was flavorless.We waited quite awhile for our wine - it was early - three servers - not a lot of tables. We caught our server's attention and inquired about the wine --- it ended-up arriving with the meal. Everything came at the same - the hot and cold dishes - which is one of my peeves.  Plus, there wasn't ample space for all of the dishes.  I understand that we ordered all small plates, but they could've asked about the delivery pattern.  Service, despite the wait, was still friendly and personable.  Now for the food. The platter consisted of dolmas,  hummus, ezme, an eggplant salad, spinach dip, a thick yogurt, a caviar dip, and a white bean salad.  The portions were typical.  The food was 50/50. Overall,  I've had better in other Turkish restaurants and homemade by Turkish friends.  The best items were the hummus, the eggplant salad, the thick yogurt, and spinach dip. The falafel were nothing special and for me, the shrimp were overcooked.  The sauce was Ok - I wanted more zip.  The food pricing was fine.  The wine was also reasonably priced.  i wouldn't go back -

803,804,"I'm a little surprised by the glowing reviews on here about Tuba.  Maybe we just had bad luck, but our experience wasn't all that great. First of all, I give them one star for finally occupying the deserted storefront that has been empty for the last few years, after the last Italian restaurant shut their doors. They also did a good job making it look nice - think red walls and dark, rich wood, which earns them another star.

I told the folks I would write a nice review about them since they gave us such a great experience.  Tuba is a nice, clean and modern Turkish restaurant, tuck between the Mission District and Noe Valley.  We would never have thought of driving to this neighborhood for dinner had it not for the Groupon deal we got (a plug for Groupon).  My Groupon would have expired to nothing, but the owner extended it for another week so I get to try their restaurant - a good business decision...I haven't had much experience with Turkish food, but I liked what I ate there. The bread was warm and has tiny sesame seeds to make it smell good.  The spiced up whipped butter was perfect for spreading.  We ordered Kofte Kebab (beef and lamb) and Shrimp Scampi - both were delicious and properly done. The vegetables were nicely done and we didn't know how to eat Turkish food, so we dipped everything into everything that was on our plate.  We topped it off with their signature dessert, the Kunefe.  The Kunefe is layered shredded dough, cheese, pistachio, fried to perfection.  It was sweet, but not over sweat, but has an interesting crusty texture for a dessert.  The biggest draw for the this restaurant was the service.  The host and waitress was very kind and attentive.  They were very nice to us.  I read some recent posting that people were annoyed with the service, but I believe it might have been because of the mass number of people arriving during the final day of Groupon expiration.  It's tough running a business, but even tougher when you have impatient customers (I am one of them from time to time).Overall 4 out of 5 Stars-Food - tasty (good tasting food doesn't have to be authentic*)-Menu - simple-Cost - reasonable, not pricey at all-Service - exceptional-Parking - only street parking, so it's a bit difficult to do on weekends.* I know I will get some people gasping for air when I said ""good tasting food doesn't have to be authentic"" so I want to clear the air.  I believe food is dynamic and can change, as long as it tastes good or better than the original.  However, I do believe authenticity is important for those who missed the taste of their homeland.  If you are tasting food for childhood memories, they have to be authentic.  My mom used to pay a lot of money for not-so-great tasting desserts and fruit.  When I asked her why she would eat something that doesn't taste good, she said the taste and flavor brings back good memories.  Now that my mother has past away, I long for home cooked meals that reminds me of my mother's cooking

Amazing, fresh out of the oven, studded with... something tasty, kinda salty... anyway, perfect. And some sort of peppered, cilantro'd butter made out of heaven and happiness. We kind of ate too much of it, honestly, especially once our waiter, Michael, brought out some sort of yoghurty dip and some spicy red stuff.We started with crab cakes for me and lentil soup for him. The crab cakes had this awesome consistency, soft and moist with a crunchy crust, and a bonus surprise of toasted pine nuts! What a perfect addition! It came with a salad that had this perfectly tangy dressing with just a hint of spice. Killer. I had trouble sharing. Boy's lentil soup was delicious, flavorful without being too salty, and again, with a hint of tang. Mediterranean. That's the thing. Right? Anyway, delicious.That reminds me. Never, during the course of our meal, did we reach for the salt or pepper. Everything was perfectly seasoned. Entrees. Yes. I had the lamb chops, Boy had the Salmon. Amazing. The salmon was perfectly tender, seasoned but not overly so. It was a great piece of fish, and you could taste it. The seasoning, and the slight bitterness in the rice (bay?) complemented, instead of covering, the taste. The lamb was perfectly cooked, with herbs that combined to make some sort of magical aura around the lamb, but I couldn't identify if you paid me a million dollars, on a bed of the same rice as the salmon, with some awesome kindofmaybe pickled carrots, zucchini and maybe cucumber? Anyway, awesome, and perfect consistency, a slight crunch, but not too much. Dessert! Boy had this incredible pyramid of panna cotta. Something like chocolate, then regular, then dark chocolate? It was some sort of creamy custardy chocolatey thing, then the most perfect panna cotta ever invented. Seriously. The whole thing was shaped into a pyramid, then covered in dark chocolate the Incas and Egyptians would be jealous of, mottled with white chocolate in cute little stripes, then surrounded in (mango? apricot? mangicot?) syrupy-puree stuff that had me literally licking his plate. When he wasn't looking. Because he's embarrassed by me sometimes. I had the house specialty, a (guys, I loved it so much I copied from the menu and emailed it to my mother with a picture) ""Kunefe: Two layers of kadayif (shredded fillo dough) filled with sweet cheese, baked to perfection, and served with homemade syrup and pistachio nuts"" Salty-sweet, warm in the middle with a cool syrup, crunchy and delicious, I can see why it was the house special. I can't wait to go back and try the other one I couldn't pronounce. Both of us had Turkish Coffee with dessert, which explains why I'm in Shotwell's Bar at 11:50 pm buzzing and drinking red wine and writing this review.

I had never heard of this place, but after combing yelp for something that seemed interesting but not too expensive, we think we scored. When we arrived, we felt like we were being welcomed into someone's home. The manager (owner?), greeted us like long lost friends. Service from start to finish was efficient and very personable and seemed to be quick without making us feel rushed. We got to sample a few by-the-glass wines before making our decision. They brought out warm flat bread with olives, feta and humus. Very yummy. We had the crab cake appetizer which was delicious. Very crabby (in a good way) and nice crisp crust on the outside (made with bulgar, I think). My entree was the beef manti. Loved the dainty little pockets and the sauce was just great. Hubby had the chicken shishkabobs which can be the epitome of sameness. This was just great. The meat was tender and flavorful. Loved the grilled veggies with it. The sole reason we picked this restaurant was to satisfy my craving for kunafe. I've had kunafe at a few other spots in the city, but this one was my favorite so far. Washed down with turkish coffee, we left stuffed and happy. As we left, we were escorted out by the manager. Really, we felt like we were regulars and if we lived closer, we probably would be.

chairs facing the wall right next to the bathroom door when my husband asked if we could sit at another table since we would not be able to see our son the host rudely responded stating that was all he had at this point my husband was irate and told him the restaurant was empty so the host offered to sit us all the way in the back of the restaurant towards the kitchenbathrooms where we were sat previous time we came in to top it off he had the nerves to say that he could not sit us anywhere else since he had reservations mind you i had reservations and was on time to my reservation we left the restaurant pretty upset on our drive to a different restaurant we received a phone call from tuba it was the same host that rudely tried sitting us in the corner because of my son instead of apologizing for the situation he was asking if we were planning on showing up to our 530 reservation when my husband flipped out the host realized who we were and decided to say it was all a misunderstanding do not go here if you have kids and want to be treated the way we were treated today it was straight discrimination against kids very unprofessional never going back and will not stop

chairs facing the wall right next to the bathroom door when my husband asked if we could sit at another table since we would not be able to see our son the host rudely responded stating that was all he had at this point my husband was irate and told him the restaurant was empty so the host offered to sit us all the way in the back of the restaurant towards the kitchenbathrooms where we were sat previous time we came in to top it off he had the nerves to say that he could not sit us anywhere else since he had reservations mind you i had reservations and was on time to my reservation we left the restaurant pretty upset on our drive to a different restaurant we received a phone call from tuba it was the same host that rudely tried sitting us in the corner because of my son instead of apologizing for the situation he was asking if we were planning on showing up to our 530 reservation when my husband flipped out the host realized who we were and decided to say it was all a misunderstanding do not go here if you have kids and want to be treated the way we were treated today it was straight discrimination against kids very unprofessional never going back and will not stop
